A hourly schedule planner. It can only store a single day's data and is only good from 9am - 5pm.

The planner will store information locally, meaning it can save your inputs if you leave or refresh the page. It also prevents you from entering data into an hour block that has already passed.

To use:
*****************************************************************
Click on the hour-block you wish to put any notes into. THen click on the blue button in the same row to save that data.

If it is already past a certain block of time, that blok will be grayed out and disabled.

The current hour block will be highlighted in red, while futre blocks will be green


TODOs
************************************************************
Improve style to give text better legibility
Reset page if it is a new day
